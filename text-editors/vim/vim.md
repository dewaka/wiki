# Vim

I'm a big fan of modal editing and specifically Vim.

### Videos

- [Derek Wyatt Vim Videos](http://derekwyatt.org/vim/tutorials/) - The first
  time I came across their videos was on global commands - [Globals, Command Line and Functions](https://vimeo.com/15443936). 
  This is a pretty good video to show some _magic_ of Vim and it is very funny to boot! This would be my
  current video of choice to show someone the power of Vim at the hands of an advanced user.
- [Greg Hurrell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPHFM88IlFn68OmLwtPmZA) - Greg's channel is not exclusively about Vim, 
  but his channel full of Vim tips and tricks.

## Tips

- Map `CapsLock` to `Esc`
