# NeoVim

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) is a fork of Vim which adds a bunch of new
features while removing less maintained parts of the Vim codebase.

Almost all the tips and tricks for [Vim](vim.md) are still applicable to NeoVim
as well.

- What excites me about Neovim?
  - Frist class Lua support - Lua is a pretty good scripting langauge with a
    very clean core and it should be orders of magnitude cleaner than VimL
    language.
