# Vim Plugins

## FZF

- [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) - Integrates `fzf` fuzzy file
  finder with Vim. I've found this to be quite a bit faster than other tools
  such as [ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim). However, one advantage of
  the latter is it is implemented fully with just Vim scripts.

## NERDTree

- How to create a new file or directory with NERDTree? 
  In the NERDTree buffer press `m` to bring up the Filesystem menu and from the menu you can create a new _node_, and a node here is either a file or a directory. To create a directory
  append `/` to the filename. Source - [Creating a new file or directory in Vim using NERDTree](https://sookocheff.com/post/vim/creating-a-new-file-or-directoryin-vim-using-nerdtree/).
  
## Light line

- This is my preferred status indicator plugin mostly due to the lightweight nature.
