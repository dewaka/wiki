# Emacs

I tend to use Emacs with _evil-mode_ for any kind of extended editing and
programming, unless I'm using an IDE (with a Vim plugin of course!) in the
latter case.

One of the disadvantages of evil-mode is that there's a high chance that
advanced commands _might_ not as expected in Emacs. For example, `:normal ...`
commands do not work in evil-mode. Also Vim regex and Emacs regex are not
really compatible - so your Vim regex know-how will not translate directly to
Emacs. So, when it comes to raw editing Vim probably is the better editor from
my experience.

However, with evil-mode one can easily use Emacs editing functionality as well
which comes with the downside of haing to learn two disparate kind of editing
paradigmns.
