# Sublime Text 

## Plugins

- Vim emulation - [NeoVintageous](https://github.com/NeoVintageous/NeoVintageous)
- [Ayu theme](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu)
- [Hide menu](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Hide%20Menu) - this plugin is
  pretty useful if you are fan of clean uncluttered looks. Sublime Text's hide
  menu behaviour does not rollover to newly created windows and this plugin
  /solves/ that problem.
