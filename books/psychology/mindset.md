## The Mindsets

- There two broad categories to which people fall under,
  - Fixed mindset - thinks one's intelligence is something very basic about
    onself and is thus fixed which one cannot change very much.
  - Growth mindset - thinks that one can change and grow and get smarter along
    the process.
