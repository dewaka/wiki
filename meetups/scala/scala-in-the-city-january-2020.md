# Scala in the City (ITV) - January, 2020

## Functional Game Programming

- Indigo is a soon-to-be-released purely functional game engine, that aims to make creating 2D indie games approachable and fun for Scala / Scala.js programmers.
- One of the goals of Indigo is to challenge the conventional wisdom that testing and reasoning about games is unavoidably difficult due to their non-deterministic nature.
- In this short talk we will cover some of the concepts behind the engine, the problems it aims to solve, and show you what a simple game project looks like.

## ZIO In Real World

- Purely functional libraries like ZIO can help you build high-performance, concurrent applications that don’t have deadlocks, don’t leak resources and can solve complex problems using purely functional code.
- In this talk, Wiem will walk you through how to build a control system for the elevators at a fictional hotel, H&A Hotel. You’ll learn how to use basic control structures like Ref, Queue, STM and ZIO to build real-world software.

- Emphasis on total functional programming reminded me of this paper by David Turner (of [Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(programming_language)) fame) - [Total Functional Programming](http://www.jucs.org/jucs_10_7/total_functional_programming/jucs_10_07_0751_0768_turner.pdf)
