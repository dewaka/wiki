# Journaling

I use [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) for private journing. Writing down
thoughts and ideas and sometimes even mundane daily details has been one of the
most positive habit I've picked over the years.

I'm trying to make useful parts of these journals public so that I have more
accountability on things I learn and pursuing goals.
