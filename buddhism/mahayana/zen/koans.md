# Zen Koans

- _Finger pointing at the moon_ - This is a very important Zen Koan about the
  role of _Dhamma_ (pointing finger) and ultimate goal, _Nirvana_ (the Moon).
  Dhamma's role is to point the finger at the direction of Nirvana as a
  guidance. The goal is to look at the Moon and not to get stuck in admiring the
  finger which is pointing at the Moon!
  
  This Koan can be compared to the Raft metaphor in Theravada Buddhism. There,
  Dhamma is often compared as a raft to cross the river (Samsara) - achieving
  Nirvana (or Nibbana, in Pali). One would be foolish to carry with himself the
  raft once they cross the river.
