# Buddhism

I found that BBC's guide on Buddhism to be quite good for a complete beginner -
[BBC - Religion: Buddhism](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/).

- [Theravada](theravada/theravada.md)
- [Mahayana](mahayana/mahayana.md)

## Films with Buddhist themes

Following are some of the films which I've liked with strong Buddhist influence.

- [Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (2003)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374546/)
