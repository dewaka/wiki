# Theravada

## Recommended Books

- [The Dhammpada](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/159964.The_Dhammapada) -
  I think Dhammapada is one of the best books to get a flavour of Buddhism for
  someone completely new to (Theravada) Buddhism.
- [What the Buddha Taught](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/390562.What_the_Buddha_Taught)
- [Satipaṭṭhāna: The Direct Path to Realization](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1220952.Satipa_h_na)
