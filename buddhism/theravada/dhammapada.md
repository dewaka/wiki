## Selected verses

- Suffering is Mind-made

  > Mind is the forerunner of (all evil) states. Mind is chief; and they are
  > mind-made. If one speaks or acts with a corrupt mind, suffering follows as
  > the wheel follows the hoof of the ox.

- Happiness is Mind-made

  > Mind is the forerunner of (all good) states. Mind is chief, and they are
  > mind-made. If one speaks or acts with pure mind, happienss follows as one's
  > own shadow that never leaves.
