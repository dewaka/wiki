- [Euclid and Pāṇini](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397332) is a paper which I came across through the reading of [Kumarasambhava](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641941.Kumarasambhava_of_Kalidasa) by Kalidasa.
  - This paper draws a comparison between the Mathematical method employed by Greek mathematician Euclid which shaped the Western philosophical tradition and the grammatical method employed by the likes of Pāṇini which shaped the Indian philosophical tradition.
