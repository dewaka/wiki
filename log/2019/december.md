# December, 2019

## Learning

- Tons of new things to learn at work.

## Coding

- Coding a bit on Rust on the side has been fun.

## Reading

- Following are some of the favourite books which I read this month,
	- [Snow by Orhan Pamuk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11691.Snow)
	- [Circe by Madeline Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959740-circe)

## Activities

- Didn't get a chance to go for a hike.
- Cold and flu meant that for the first time this year, I missed out running for more than a week.
- Year end Rust meetup was interesting where I got to know about async-std from one of the main contributors.
