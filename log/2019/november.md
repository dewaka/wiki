# November, 2019

## Learning

- Tons of new things to learn at work.

## Coding

- Coding a on two small side projects in Rust has been fun. 

## Reading

- Final target of 100 books a year seems very realistic now since I managed to have a couple of very productive reading weeks.

## Activities

- Wasn't very consistent when it comes to running. On the other hand when I did manage to run they were pretty fast. I tend to run fast in colder conditions - mostly to keep myself warm since I tend to under-dress for runs!
