# September, 2019

## Learning

- [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - using Cython to optimise
  latency critical code in existing Python codebases.
- Minimal perfect hashing.
- [Programming by Optimisation](http://www.prog-by-opt.net/).
- Changed Emacs configuration from Spacemacs to Doom Emacs. I do like the faster
  startup of the Doom config. Still getting used to the `ivy`, `counsel` and
  `swyper`. (Ref. [Ivy, Counsel and Swiper](https://writequit.org/denver-emacs/presentations/2017-04-11-ivy.html)).

## Coding

- [Clause and Effect: PROLOG Programming for the Working Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1242949) - 
  worked through Prolog code from the book.
- A bit of Rust coding for command line Beeminder client I've been working on
  and off.

## Reading

- Got the poetry bug and read a couple of poetry selections from [Mary Oliver](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23988.Mary_Oliver) 
  and selected poems book from Robert Frost which I could find in project Gutenberg.

## Activities

- Started a [personal wiki](https://wiki.dewaka.com)!
- Relatively better month for running. Last two months were terrible by my usual
  standards. Sticked to shorter 7k runs in the morning to increase weekly
  mileage slowly.
- Still hovering around 950 elo rating in Chess on 10 minute format at
  chess.com. Not really happy with the lack of progress there. I still keep
  making blunders which ruins games, sometimes in promising positions.
  
  I don't think the faster format is really the best format for improving Chess,
  but that's the format which I enjoy most due to quick games.
