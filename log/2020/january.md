## Books

- [Beauty by Roger Scruton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6323955-beauty)
  - My first foray into aesthetics theory.
- [The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216363.The_Man_in_the_High_Castle)
  - I quite liked the first TV series from Amazon - [The Man in the High Castle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740299/), then lost interest to follow up on later series (which might change in the future!).
  - Without writing too many spoilers, the TV series has far more character development than the book and it is more _based_ on the book rather than _faithful_ to the book.
- [The Summer Without Men by Siri Hustvedt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10223697-the-summer-without-men)
  - This is an interesting book on a woman's perspective on dealing with a _midlife_ crisis of sorts.
  - Early chapters reminded me of [Girl, Interrupted (1999)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172493/) , which is one of my favourite films. Although both protagonists go through a breakdown, that's probably where the similarities end! 
  - This reminds me that I should pick up [Girl, Interrupted](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68783.Girl_Interrupted) book itself.
- [Catullus: The Poems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/287155.Catullus) 
  - Curiosity read since I haven't read many (if any) Roman poets before.
  - Quite liked the mythical poems on Thesius etc.
  - There are some sharp, quite quotable short poems, too.
- [The Blue Room](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140590.The_Blue_Room)
  - Similar theme to [Unfaithful (2002)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250797/)
    film, although this book is much older.
  - Quite an interesting short story.
- [Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213233.Better)
  - Quite an interesting book on medication profession which I do not know much about.
  - Stories on how doctors in poor countries and areas adapt to the unique challenges and rise to the occasion were quite inspiring to read.
  - Advice on getting better in once professoin is, I think, applicable to other fields as well.
- [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice)
  - It was a long awaited read for me to finally to read Pride and Prejudice.
  - I've seen [Pride & Prejudice (2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414387/) film some time back and reading books of Jane Austen was quite high on my list.
  - I picked up reading reading this book while parallel reading other books, but after the first couple of chapters I could almost not put it down, and read it solely till I finished it!
- [The Bridges of Madison County](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83674.The_Bridges_of_Madison_County)
  - I picked up this short book solely based on how much I liked the film [The Bridges of Madison County (1995)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112579/), and I think my ratings for the book, is biased based on the liking to the film as well.
- [The Lathe of Heaven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven) 
  - This is the first Ursula Le Guin book for me. 
  - I've been eyeing to read her science fiction books for a while and I'm quite glad that I started with this one. 
  - It is a pretty awesome story which is hard to describe. 
- [The End of the Affair](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29641.The_End_of_the_Affair) 
  - I had seen the movie based on the novel a long time ago [The End of the Affair (1999)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172396/) and I quite liked the film even though I found its ending a bit gloomy at the time. 
  - The book evoked even stronger emotions for me. I'm not even sure whether to call this book just a run of the mill love story. 
  - The second half is _almost_ religious and spiritual. I found the novel quite nihilistic and religious at the same time.
  - Most of all, I like the brutal honesty of the protagonist who fights till the end to keep his nihilistic world view. I'm not sure whether it is nihilistic - at least he believed in love, so there's something!

## Films and TV

- [Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/) - Finally finished the series. Even though I didn't like the later series all that much I was sad to see the series finish.
- [The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5788792/)
