## Books

- [Mindset](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset)
  - This is a book I've been meaning to read for quite some time and actually knew its central message quite well, already.
  - I skim read the book while taking [notes](../../books/psychology/mindset.md).
  - As with most psychology and self help books, this one is also filled with stories which can be safely skipped if you actually _get_ the underlying points.
