## Books

- [Mindset](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset)
  - This is a book I've been meaning to read for quite some time and actually knew its central message quite well, already.
  - I skim read the book while taking [notes](../../books/psychology/mindset.md).
  - As with most psychology and self help books, this one is also filled with stories which can be safely skipped if you actually _get_ the underlying points.
  
- [Find Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44581535-find-me)
  - I quite like the Call Me By Your Name by the same author and that's why I picked up this book.
  - This was a pretty quick read, but I found the plots and characters in the most part unbelievalble. 
  - This lack of genuineness almost ruined the book for me, but finished it nonetheless since it was a quick read.
  - References to classics, such as hidden Roman galleries, was one of the few redeeming qualities of the book for me.

- [Lord of the Flies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies)

## Entertaintment

- [Parasite (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/)
  - Simply one of the best films I've seen this year thus far.
  - This is a tragicomedy about class struggle.

- [1917 (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8579674/)
  - I almost liked this film more than Dunkirk!
  - This film succeeds in portraying the horrors and sheer insanity of the World War I.

- [La boh√®me](https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/la-boheme-by-richard-jones-dates)
