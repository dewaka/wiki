# Parallels with Buddhism

There are a lot of similarities in thinking and meditations by practioners of
Stoicism and Buddhist's teachings such as,
- [Eight Wordly Concerns](../../buddhism/theravada/eight-worldly-concerns.md)
- [Vipassana](../../mindfullness/meditation/vipassana.md)

An essay from Prof. Massimo Pigliucci on the same subject - 
[Rationally Speaking: Buddhism, Epicureanism, and Stoicism](https://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2013/02/buddhism-epicureanism-and-stoicism.html).
