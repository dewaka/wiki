# Running Shoes

Which shoes to chose for running is a very personal choice and this should be
based on a multitude of factors. Following are just some of the shoes which _I_
happen to like and found to work well for me.

## Shoe type

There are many different running shoe types out there catering to various foot
shapes and styles. I think it is pretty important to pick the right type of shoe
for your foot and this is a lesson which I learned from experience myself. As a
novice runner one of the first shoes I tried was a Brooks "support" shoe and
that didn't work well for me at all. I started getting knee pain and during my
earlier running years I had no such pain and I used to run in simple shoes or
sometimes barefoot in a grass play ground. After changing back to a neutral
cushioned shoe that my pain went away. Lesson learned about what's the right
shoe type for me.

It is the same with stack height. I have come to notice that for my natural
running style, I prefer shoes with lower stack heights even though this is not
as important as the type of the shoe for me. As shown below, the shoes I have in
regular rotation are 0mm-6mm in stack height range.

## Favourites

- Saucony Kinvara - 4mm drop, neutral training type of shoe has been a staple in
  my rotation for a couple of years now. Usually I manage to get 1000k+ mileage
  out of them.
- New Balance Fresh Foam Zante - Quite similar to Kinvara. I liked the first
  version so much that I had about 4 pairs of them. They are very comfortable
  even for both long runs and speedy runs alike for me.
- Vibram Bikila - I do not run in these shoes regularly, but time to time I like
  to run in them if I feel like I'm regressing when it comes to good foot strike
  patterns (for me). These shoes are pretty good to get a "natural" running
  stride and I especially like the freedom and increased balance which comes
  from natural toe splaying since these shoes fits like a glove.

  You have to be especially careful with sizing with Vibram shoes and the sizes
  can vary (slightly) between models.
  
  I also do not recommend getting into minimalist running shoes unless you have
  prior experience running barefoot. Minimalist shoes like these with their very
  low stack heights puts strain on different parts of your legs. So, do not be
  surprised if your calves are sore after a run in these shoes for the first
  couple of runs.
