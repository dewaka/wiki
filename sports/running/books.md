# Books on and about Running

## Motivating books!

- [Once a Runner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98250.Once_a_Runner) - as
  far as motivating running novels go, this is probably at the top of my list
  from the ones I've read thus far.
- [Born to Run](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run) - this
  book probably single handedly started the minimalist running shoe craze. Even
  though barefoot or natural running is not for everyone, this book definitely
  made me a better and more knowledgeable runner.
- [Again to Carthage](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2124589.Again_to_Carthage) -
  This is a sequel to the first novel `Once a Runner` by the same author. I quite liked this as well.
- [Running with the Buffaloes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125912.Running_with_the_Buffaloes) -
  Based on a true story, this books chronicles a season with a cross country
  team at the University of Colorado. Highly recommended.
- [What I Talk About When I Talk About Running](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running) -
  this is a pretty short book on the topic of running and other things by Haruki
  Murakami.

There are many other motivating running books which I'm yet to read!

## Running know how

- Jack Daniels' Running Formula - I have _not_ read this book cover to cover,
  but this is one of the most well regarded books on scientific training plans
  you can find.
