## Techniques

- Natural running - Emphasis on a few set of core elements conducive to _good_ technique.
- Pose running - Strong emphasis on running Pose with a forefoot strike pattern.
- Chi running - This running technique emphasises on breathing and mid-foot
  strike.
  
I do not think there's any particular technique universally applicable to
runners of all shape and form. However, there are common elements which almost
all these techniques promotes,
- High cadence with short strides
- Slight forward lean - although this is not too important. The important part
  is getting your body slightly forward or just underneath when you land on your
  forward strike.
  
## General advice

This is some advice which has worked for _me_. Everybody is different and you
shouldn't take this advice as the last word and do your own research. Also
following advice is from a perspective of a recreational runner who almost never
does races!
- Start by running slowly. If starting after a long period of inactivity or
  starting recreational running for the first time, then even running as low as
  15 minutes is good enough.
- In the beginning aim for running short distances (or based on time), but aim
  to run consistently. Running 4 to 5 times a week would be a good target.
- For rest days, which are important, try to get some strength training based on
  especially targeting muscles you find weak. Your body aches would be a pretty
  good guide here!
- Slowly increase weekly mileage. I think early on consistency on how often you
  run is more important than mileage, unless you are specifically training for
  an event.
