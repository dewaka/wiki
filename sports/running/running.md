# Running

## Techniques

- Natural running - Emphasis on a few set of core elements conducive to _good_ technique.
- Pose running - Strong emphasis on running Pose with a forefoot strike pattern.
- Chi running - This running technique emphasises on breathing and mid-foot
  strike.
  
I do not think there's any particular technique universally applicable to
runners of all shape and form. However, there are common elements which almost
all these techniques promotes,
- High cadence with short strides
- Slight forward lean - although this is not too important. The important part
  is getting your body slightly forward or just underneath when you land on your
  forward strike.

## Instructional videos

- [Principles of Natural Running with Dr. Mark Cucuzzella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo) - This is probably
  the best instructional video on _natural running_ I've come across thus far.
- [Observations on good running technique with Olympian Victoria Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVH2qOwZd18) - This is also a pretty
  good video on elements of good running technique.
- [Chris Erichsen - Mile Repeats - 2011 USA Olympic Marathon Trials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLKkx5yYZes) - Really nice form and
  just the ambience of the running video makes you want to go for a run, at
  least in my case!
