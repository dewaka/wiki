## Channels and Streams

- [John Bartholomew](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6hOVYvNn79Sl1Fc1vx2mYA) -
  This is a very good channel for beginner to intermediate level players who
  wants to get better. When John streams, he usually explains his reasoning for
  moves and they are pretty instructive.
- [agadmator's Chess Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA) - 
  This is a great channel to just enjoy both modern and older classic chess games.
- [GMHikaru](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweCc7bSMX5J4jEH7HFImng) - 
	Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura's channel is a pretty active one since he streams
	Blitz chess pretty regularly. Follow it to see a Chess tactical genius at work!
	However, Blitz at that level is a very poor format for actual learning because
	things happen too quickly for beginner or even intermediate level players at
	Hikaru's level.

## Resources

- Lichess - This is a great free resource for tactics
  [training](https://lichess.org/training/89238) and [analysing](https://lichess.org/analysis) games.
- Chess.com - Probably has the biggest chess playing audience. Their paid
  offerings seem to be pretty good value if you are serious about improving.
- Chessbase - I'm a little disappointed that Chessbase does not have an offering for Linux or macOS users.
