## Channels and Streams

- [John Bartholomew](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6hOVYvNn79Sl1Fc1vx2mYA) -
  This is a very good channel for beginner to intermediate level players who
  wants to get better. When John streams, he usually explains his reasoning for
  moves and they are pretty instructive.
- [agadmator's Chess Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5YbN5WLFD8dLIegT5QAbA) - 
  This is a great channel to just enjoy both modern and older classic chess games.
- [GMHikaru](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweCc7bSMX5J4jEH7HFImng) - 
  Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura's channel is a pretty active one since he streams
  Blitz chess pretty regularly. Follow it to see a Chess tactical genius at work!
  However, Blitz at that level is a very poor format for actual learning because
  things happen too quickly for beginner or even intermediate level players at
  Hikaru's level.
- Matthew Sadler's videos on AlphaZero play against Stockfish in chess24
  network's YouTube channel are very interesting due to AlphaZero's novelties in
  very well studied positions to outplay traditional engines like Stockfish. One
  good example of innovative, almost _alien_ play by AlphaZero is 
  ["Long-term Sacrifice" | DeepMind's AlphaZero vs. Stockfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JacRX6cKIaY).

## Resources

- Lichess - This is a great free resource for tactics
  [training](https://lichess.org/training/89238) and [analysing](https://lichess.org/analysis) games.
- Chess.com - Probably has the biggest chess playing audience. Their paid
  offerings seem to be pretty good value if you are serious about improving.
- Chessbase - I'm a little disappointed that Chessbase does not have an offering
  for Linux or macOS users.
