## Favourite equipment

- Jackets
  - [Arc'teryx Atom LT Hoody](https://arcteryx.com/gb/en/shop/mens/atom-lt-hoody) 
    - Even though it is not the cheapest of hoodies you can find, I found this to be the most versatile, useful and comfortable hiking jacket I've gotten thus far.
    - It is not water-proof, but can easily withstand a light shower without any issues
    - For colder times, AR version of the hoodie might be better. Or you can wear another warm base layer with the LT hoodie.
- Hiking shoes
  - [Merrell Men's Moab 2 Mid Gore-tex High Rise](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B071FWYZXT/)
  - [Salomon X Ultra 3 Prime GTX](https://www.salomon.com/en-gb/shop-emea/product/x-ultra-3-prime-gtxr.html)
    - Superbly water proof and has kept my feet dry walking through ankle deep puddles!
    - Grip is really secure as well.
    - I find myself wearing this shoe for most hikes due to better breathability as this shoe is lower than the Merrell one above.
