# TLDR

[tldr](https://tldr.sh/) pages are similar to man pages, but are shorter and
more example based.

- To see examples on how to use [ripgrep](ripgrep.md),

  ```
  tldr ripgrep
  ```
- To see platform specific versions of a command, say `tar`, use the `-p` option
  as follows,
  
  ```
  tldr -p linux tar
  ```
  
  Other supported platforms include `osx`, `sunos`, and `common`.
